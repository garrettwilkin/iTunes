iTunes: an implementation of the iTunes API in Node.js.

Authored by Garrett Wilkin (http://geethink.com/blog)

It uses both the iTunes API for retrieving media information and the LinkShare API for generating affiliate links to the iTunes store. See an example in simple-node.js.

Currently, the iTunes API is implemented and tested for searching for album information.  See an example in simple-node.js.  A callback function is required in order to use this package.  The basic steps to using it are:

1. Decide that you want to retrieve some media meta data (only albums supported currently)
2. Write a function to process this meta data (display it, store it in a database etc.)
3. initialize an instance of iTunes.
4. call lookupAlbum supply the media information (e.g. album name, artist name) and the callback function that will process the result.

A very basic use:


  var itunesClient = new iTunes();
  itunesClient.lookupAlbum({artist: 'Smashing Pumpkins', album: 'Siamese Dream'}, function(error, album) {
     <callback function definition>
     }
  );

See simple-node.js for a practical  example implementation of the libraries.
