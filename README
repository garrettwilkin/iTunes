It uses both the iTunes API for retrieving media information and the LinkShare API for generating affiliate links to the iTunes store.

See simple-node.js for a practical  example implementation of the libraries.

To Do:
-----
* Update for Node. 0.4.1
* Add more winston logging
  - use file and console transport simultaneously
* Make installable via npm
* Add Last.fm API
* Add Amazon API
* Add 7Digital API
* Add that lyrics API service... what was it?
